This contains tools required for the development of NABU software.

MID2NT - C# program converts MIDI files to NT (nabu tracker) files. 

ICON Creator - C# program to generate icons for headless app icons and news. Generates 32x32 byte pattern and color used in the filesv3.json and news.json. If you have an app that you wish to be hosted on cloud.nabu.ca with headless access, I'd prefer it if you created an icon, so email me the nabuIcon file with your program. I'm not good at design :)
