life: an implementation of Conway's "Game of Life" for CP/M 2.2
===============================================================

"life" is yet another implementation of Conway's famous cellular simulation
for CP/M. It's designed to be used on a CP/M machine with a fast connection
to a VT100/ANSI terminal, because the display is generated by sending
terminal control codes.

At present, nothing is configurable at run-time. The simulation is on a 32x16
grid, which is about as much as a Z80 system can cope with. When it's
running, hit 'R' to restart the simulation with a different, random starting
position, or 'Q' to quit.
