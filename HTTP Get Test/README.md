## Description
This project demonstrates the remote filesystem functions of NABU-LIB. These functions will migrate to support the Cloud CP/M that will offer remote filesystem capabilities to the CP/M operating system - no longer requiring the NABU to have local storage.

The demo will download a file from the cloud.nabu.ca website, and display it to the screen. It then saves the file to the Internet Adapter's file system. Alters the file. And displays the file from the file system.
